The bot was originally called **m1t3nk0v.b0t**, but it was recently rewritten, so the name and design were changed.

### What's new?
* Command handler
* New command **invert** for inverting images
* **eval** got a slight revamp
* A slight cut in **8ball** answer list
* **rate** is still in its entirety so far :^)

### Planned features
* Multi-language
* Moderation commands
